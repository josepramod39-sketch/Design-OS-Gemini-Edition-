# Application Shell Specification

## Overview
A minimal, clean header layout designed for high-focus tasks. The shell provides persistent access to the four main modules of EdithRp while keeping the interface clutter-free.

## Navigation Structure
**Top Header Navigation:**
- **Inventory & Scanning**
- **Analytics Dashboard**
- **Predictive Insights**
- **Voice Command Center**

## Global Actions
- **Voice Trigger:** A prominent microphone button in the header for instant access to voice commands from any screen.

## User Menu
- **Location:** Top right corner.
- **Contents:** User Avatar, Name, Settings, Logout.

## Layout Pattern
**Minimal Top Header:**
- Fixed height header (e.g., 64px).
- Content area fills the rest of the viewport.
- Navigation links are centered or left-aligned within the header.

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop:** Full links visible in the header.
- **Tablet:** Condensed links or icon-only navigation.
- **Mobile:** Hamburger menu opens a drawer containing the navigation links. Voice trigger remains visible in the header.

## Design Notes
- Uses **Space Grotesk** for navigation labels to align with the "Command Center" aesthetic.
- **Violet** accent color indicates the active section.
- **Zinc** neutrals for a clean, high-contrast background.
